                Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.

Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.[1][2]

Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruits to India. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India.[3]

Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.[4] Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (Britain in particular), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.[5][6]

World Wildlife Fund (WWF)’s Living Planet Report released on 10 October 2024 emphasized India’s food consumption pattern as the most sustainable among the big economies
                Indian cuisine reflects an 8,000-year history of various groups and cultures interacting with the Indian subcontinent, leading to diversity of flavours and regional cuisines found in modern-day India. Later, trade with British and Portuguese influence added to the already diverse Indian cuisineAfter 9000 BCE, a first period of indirect contacts between Fertile Crescent and Indus Valley civilizations seems to have occurred as a consequence of the Neolithic Revolution and the diffusion of agriculture. Wheat and barley were first grown around 7000 BCE, when agriculture spread from the Fertile Crescent to the Indus Valley. Sesame and humped cattle were domesticated in the local farming communities. Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia. By 3000 BCE, turmeric, cardamom, black pepper and mustard were harvested in IndiaFrom Around 2350 BCE the evidence for imports from the Indus to Ur in Mesopotamia have been found, as well as Clove heads which are thought to originate from the Moluccas in Maritime Southeast Asia were found in a 2nd millennium BC site in Terqa. Akkadian Empire records mention timber, carnelian and ivory as being imported from Meluhha by Meluhhan ships, Meluhha being generally considered as the Mesopotamian name for the Indus Valley Civilization.

                Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bājra), rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a variety of lentils, such as masoor (most often red lentils), tuer (pigeon peas), urad (black gram), and moong (mung beans). Lentils may be used whole, dehusked—for example, dhuli moong or dhuli urad—or split. Split lentils, or dal, are used extensively.[31] Some pulses, such as channa or cholae (chickpeas), rajma (kidney beans), and lobiya (black-eyed peas) are very common, especially in the northern regions. Channa and moong are also processed into flour (besan).

                Many Indian dishes are cooked in vegetable oil, but peanut oil is popular in northern and western India, mustard oil in eastern India,[26] and coconut oil along the western coast, especially in Kerala and parts of southern Tamil Nadu.[32][self-published source?] Gingelly (sesame) oil is common in the south since it imparts a fragrant, nutty aroma.[33]
                
                In recent decades, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, and soybean oils have become popular across India.[34] Hydrogenated vegetable oil, known as Vanaspati ghee, is another popular cooking medium.[35] Butter-based ghee, or deshi ghee, is used commonly.
                
                Many types of meat are used for Indian cooking, but chicken and mutton tend to be the most commonly consumed meats. Fish and beef consumption are prevalent in some parts of India, but they are not widely consumed except for coastal areas, as well as the north east.The most important and frequently used spices and flavourings in Indian cuisine are whole or powdered chilli pepper (mirch, introduced by the Portuguese from Mexico in the 16th century), black mustard seed (sarso), cardamom (elaichi), cumin (jeera), turmeric (haldi), asafoetida (hing), ginger (adrak), coriander (dhania), and garlic (lasoon).[36]

                One popular spice mix is garam masala, a powder that typically includes seven dried spices in a particular ratio, including black cardamom, cinnamon (dalchini), clove (laung), cumin (jeera), black peppercorns, coriander seeds and anise star.[37][self-published source?]. Each culinary region has a distinctive garam masala blend—individual chefs may also have their own.
                
                The spices chosen for a dish are freshly ground and then fried in hot oil or ghee to create a paste. The process is called bhuna, the name also being used for a type of curry.[38]
                
                There are other spice blends which are popular in various regions. Panch phoron is a spice blend which is popular in eastern India. Goda masala is a sweet spice mix which is popular in Maharashtra. Some leaves commonly used for flavouring include bay leaves (tejpat), coriander leaves, fenugreek (methi) leaves, and mint leaves. The use of curry leaves and roots for flavouring is typical of Gujarati[39] and South Indian cuisine.[40] Sweet dishes are often seasoned with cardamom, saffron, nutmeg, and rose petal essences. </p>

                Cuisine differs across India's diverse regions as a result of variation in local culture, geographical location (proximity to sea, desert, or mountains), and economics. It also varies seasonally, depending on which fruits and vegetables are ripe.
            </p>
            <p>Seafood plays a major role in the cuisine of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.[41] Staples of the diet of the Indigenous Andamanese traditionally include roots, honey, fruits, meat, and fish, obtained by hunting and gathering. Some insects were also eaten as delicacies.[42] Immigration from mainland of India, however, has resulted in variations in the cuisine.</p>
           <p>The cuisine of Andhra Pradesh belongs to the two Telugu-speaking regions of Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra and is part of Telugu cuisine. The food of Andhra Pradesh is known for its heavy use of spices, and the use of tamarind.

            Seafood is common in the coastal region of the state. Rice is the staple food (as is with all South Indian states) eaten with lentil preparations such as pappu (lentils) and pulusu (stew) and spicy vegetables or curries.
            
            In Andhra, leafy greens or vegetables such as bottle-gourd and eggplant are usually added to dal. Pickles are an essential part of the local cuisine; popular among those are mango-based pickles such as avakaya and maagaya, gongura (a pickle made from sorrel leaves),[43] usirikaya (gooseberry or amla), nimmakaya (lime), and tomato pickle.
            
            Perugu (yogurt) is a common addition to meals, as a way of tempering spiciness. Breakfast items include dosa, pesarattu (mung bean dosa), vada, and idli.</p>
            <p>The staple food of Arunachal Pradesh is rice, along with fish, meat, and leaf vegetables.[44] Native tribes of Arunachal are meat eaters and use fish, eggs, beef, chicken, pork, and mutton to make their dishes.

                Many varieties of rice are used. Boiled rice cakes wrapped in leaves are a popular snack. Thukpa is a kind of noodle soup common among the Monpa tribe of the region.[45]
                
                Lettuce is the most common vegetable, usually prepared by boiling with ginger, coriander, and green chillies.[46]
                
                Apong or rice beer made from fermented rice or millet is a popular beverage in Arunachal Pradesh and is consumed as a refreshing drink.</p>

        <h1 class="head">Hyderabad Biriyani</h1>

           <div class="size3"></div>
           <p>Hyderabadi biryani (also known as Hyderabadi dum biryani) is a style of biryani originating from Hyderabad, India made with basmati rice and meat (mostly mutton). Originating in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines. Hyderabad biryani is a key dish in Hyderabadi cuisine and it is so famous that the dish is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad.Hyderabad was conquered by the Mughals in the 1630s, and ruled by its Nizams. Mughlai culinary traditions joined with local traditions to create Hyderabadi cuisine.[1] : 92  Local folklore attributes the creation of Hyderabadi biryani to the chef of the first Nizam, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I, in the mid-18th century, during a hunting expedition.[2][3] In 1857, when the Mughal Empire declined in Delhi, Hyderabad emerged as the center of South Asian culture,[4][5] resulting in a mix of innovations in Hyderabadi biryaniThe exact origin of the dish is uncertain. Despite legends attributing it to the Nizam's chef, the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to South Asia by Arab traders. Pulao may have been an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. The distinction between "pulao" and "biryani" is arbitrary.[9][10] Hyderabadi biryani developed engrossing Deccani or Telangana flavors into it, as stated by the Himayat Ali Mirza, the great-grandson of Mir Osman Ali Khan. Himayat said that this evolution had taken place in the Asaf Jah’s Kitchen Hyderabadi Biryani, the word alone should get your taste buds tingling and your jaws aching with sweet pain. And if it’s not like this, you haven't yet had the Best Hyderabadi Biryani. Biryani has become the mirror image of the Indian population and as the clock is ticking a test of time Biryani has survived longer than any human being and will remain forever as they bring flavour, taste, texture, nuance, lore, legend all into the conversation.


            Hyderabadi Biryani is one of the most popular Biryanis in India. Also known as Hyderabadi Dum Biryani, it is a style of Biryani from Hyderabad. Originating in the kitchen of the Nizams of Hyderabad, it has a blend of both Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines.Chicken Dum Biryani is an art perfected in the Nizams' kitchens. This is one royal dish that has stayed the course for more than 400 years, narrating a confluence of cultures, flavors, and techniques for biryani hyderabadi. The invariable process of slowcooking, or dum, with marinated chicken-layers of rice in a sealed pot-so that all the aromas are locked inside and not let out into the atmosphere is the very heart of biryani hyderabad.


            True richness of the biryani hyderabadi chicken is basically marinated overnight in yogurt and spices, so each piece of it tastes with a different flavor. Then it is layered with fragrant basmati rice and topped with fried onions, mint, and coriander, which gives the biryani its uniquely characteristic taste.</p>
